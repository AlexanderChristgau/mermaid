# iMagE Registration via autoMAtIc Differentiation

Mermaid is a registration toolkit making use of automatic differentiation for rapid prototyping. It runs on the CPU and the GPU, though GPU acceleration only becomes obvious for large images or 3D volumes. 

*We are currently in the process of releasing the first version of mermaid* with pytorch 1.x compatibility.
