# Spatial transformer code for 1D, 2D, and 3D

This spatial transformer code is heavily inspired by the pyTorch spatial transformer code by Fei Xia found here:

https://github.com/fxia22/stn.pytorch

However, this code extends it so that now also 1D and 3D images can be spatially transformed.

# TODO

Also port the cuda code
